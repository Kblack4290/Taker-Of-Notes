# Taker Of Notes

https://the-taker-of-notes.herokuapp.com/


## Description

This application serves as an easy to use note taker. The user is able to create notes and save them for future reference. Then when the user does not need the note anymore they can delete it. 

The application uses express.js, node.js, fs, and path for it to come together an work responsively. Using express helps connect the front end code with the server on the back end, making it possible to deploy a fully functional application with Heroku. Please check out the link above.
